Function of exchange -
	a) Determine the queues to which message has to be routed.
	b) Based on exchange type appropriate routing algo will be used to route messages.


Attributes of rabbitmq used by exchanges-
	a) Bounding Key - Created when we bind an exchange with an queue
					- Every queue that is created, needs to be binded by some exchange.
					- Else the message published to that exchange will be lost.
	
	
	b) Routing Key	- Passed by publisher along with the message to be published.
					- When the routing key matches a binding key of a queue, message is routed to that queue.
					

Exchange Types-
	a) Fan-out Exchange	- Used to broadcast message to all queues linked to that exchange. (Routing key in this case will be in-effective and ignored.)
	b) Direct Exchange	- Uses routing key and binding key to route messages.
	c) Topic Exchange 	- Uses routing key and binding key to route messages. It can handle wild card characters in routing key. (* - it will match one 
						  or more words and # - it will match zero or more words).
	d) Header Exchange	- Uses Headers to route messages. Parameters defined in the header message should match with the parameters specified in the
						  binding queue, only then will the message be routed to that queue.
